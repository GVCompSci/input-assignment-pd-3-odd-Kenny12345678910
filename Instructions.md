Project 1
Input and operations

For this project you will be creating a program which will prompt a user for their name and telephone number (take the number as a String so that they can enter the - ) .  You will then prompt them for the name of a product that they would like to purchase, followed by the price of the item, and the quantity that they would like to purchase.   Our program will then calculate the tax (6%), and the total price.   You will display all of the information in a nicely formatted way as displayed below.  

 Sample of the console when the program is complete:

Price of the item:  299.50
